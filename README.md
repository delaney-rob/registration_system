Basic Registration System 
-------------------------

This was a college project coded in python and hosted on google app engine. The aim was to get a basic understanding of a jinja2, python project that was implemented on google's app engine. 

The project can be seen running here: http://empirical-mote-865.appspot.com/

At present all files are in the same folder but my aim for the future (when I get time!) will be to re-organise the files into a proper structure, but for the sake of this college project, this layout was acceptable.
